Skipgram modelling is a technique for generating multi-word terms that preserves some of the sequentiality and flexibility of the language. However, in some cases the number of skipgrams generated may become excessive as the distance between words increases. Moreover, this distance is often not taken into account when evaluating the terms that are generated. In this paper we propose a technique for efficient skipgram generation and filtering, and a weighing scheme that takes into account the distance between terms, giving more importance to those closer. We will apply and evaluate these proposals in the task of sentiment analysis.
